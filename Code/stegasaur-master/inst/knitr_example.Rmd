```{r}

library(stegasaur)
knit_hooks$set(figasaur = hook_figasaur)
```

# A brief example

Here we show that when we make the figure we can read it back in and get the code that generated it back.

```{r figasaur=TRUE}
plot(sample(100))
```

We could now use `stegasaur::decode` on the resulting file to find out how the figure was created (this should display `plot(sample(100))`).


```{r}
decode()
```
